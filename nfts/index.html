    <h1>What are NFTs?</h1>

    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>NFTs stand for Non-fungible tokens.  When an object is non fungible, this means that it cannot be exchanged for other items.  Each of these tokens is unique because it has its own data that cannot be replicated.</li>
        <li>Common examples of NFTs include digital artwork, an essay, or even a ticket to an event.  An NFT allows these examples to be tokenized, giving each an owner and protection through Ethereum blockchain.</li></ul>

  <div class="sect">
    <h1>How do NFTs work?</h1>
    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>NFTs can be created for anything that is stored digitally and holds value.  This shows that the digital asset has ownership that can be bought and sold like physical art.</li>
        <li>NFTs can be traded using Ethereum.  This is different from companies that sell items/tokens because they would have to create their own infrastructure for trading.</li>
        <li>Creators hold the ownership rights and can claim resale benefits directly.  There can only be one owner at a time and the information is tracked in Ethereum’s blockchain.  The process for creating an NFT starts by creating a new block then validating information and finally, translating the information into the blockchain.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <div class="sect">
    <h1>How are NFTs bought and sold?</h1>
    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>NFTs are bought and sold on trading websites such as Ethereum. When you buy an NFT from ethereum, you can easily sell it on different programs because “all Ethereum products can easily understand each other. </li>
        <li>When you trade an NFT the transaction is public which allows for easy tracking of ownership. This can be used to verify your NFTs ownership history.
        </li>
        <li>You can sell an NFT on a program or through peer-to-peer transactions which takes out the need for platforms which take large cuts of the transaction as compensation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="sect">
    <h1>How does ownership work?</h1>
    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>If you are a creator of an NFT you can retain ownership rights over your work, which you can then use to collect royalties in the future if a future owner makes a profit on your work.
        </li>
        <li>NFTs can only have one owner at a time, and this ownership can be tracked through the ownership history for proof of ownership. 
        </li>
        <li>When you own an NFT you have a private key for access to it. This private key is proof of ownership of the original work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fractional NFTs are experimental right now, but they allow creators to create shares for their work similar to shares in the stock market. This will allow many people to share ownership of the same piece of work.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <div class="sect">
    <h1>What are the environmental impacts of NFTs?</h1>
    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>Because NFTs are created using Ethereum, they currently create a large carbon footprint. However, NFTs are not more energy intensive than other Ethereum uses.
        </li>
        <li>Overall, the estimated yearly energy consumption of Ethereum is 44.49TWh (4,449,000,000kWh). This is a lot but improvements are being developed.
        </li>
        <li>Most of the energy usage is in order to keep Ethereum (and by extension NFTs) decentralized and secure. These improvements, known as Eth2, change the process to do this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Current estimates show that the yearly energy usage of Eth2 will be 2.62MWh (2,620,000kWh). This is more than a 99% decrease in energy usage.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="sect">
    <h1>What are the environmental impacts of NFTs?</h1>
    <div class="subsect">
      <ul>
        <li>One of the major benefits of NFTs is that they give digital artists a way to monetize their work. The ownership aspect of NFTs allows creators to sell their work and directly profit from it. Other types of creators benefit from this aspect but digital ones face the most benefits.</li>
        <li>For NFT owners, there is the benefit that they can prove ownership.  While there can be many copies of the content of the NFT, the value comes from having ownership.
        </li>
